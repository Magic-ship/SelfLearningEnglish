  <h3>5 Base Rules of English Writing</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>1. Try to avoid overly long sentences</strong>
      <p>Long sentences aren't necessarily bad, but lose your audience, they are.</p>
      <p>As a rule of thumb, a sentence should not have more than <b>10</b> to <b>15</b> words.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>2. Each sentence should make a clear statement</strong>
      <p>If should add to the statement that went before, a good paragraph is a serious of clear, linked statement.</p>
      <p>As a rule of thumb, a paragraph should not consist of 100 to 200 words.</p>
      <ul>
        <strong>Change paragraphs when ...</strong>
        <li>A new character comes along</li>
        <li>A new event happens</li>
        <li>A new idea is introduced</li>
        <li>The setting changes.</li>
        <li>A new person is speaking</li>
        <li>Time moves forward or backward a lot.</li>
        <li>The "camera" moves</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>3. Do not use words whose meanings you not sure of.</strong>
      <li>Try to avoid wanting to sound intelligent by using words that you don't understand. Know the word that you use.</li>
      <li>If you need to use special words, look them up in dictionary before, or use words that you understand instead.</li>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>4. Use concrete rather than vague language.</strong>
      <p><b>Vague</b> : The weather was of an extreme nature of the West Coast.</p>
      <ul>   This sentence raises frustrating questions:
        <li>When did this extreme weather occur?</li>
        <li>What does of an "extreme weather" mean?</li>
        <li>Where on the West Coast did this take place?</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Concrete</b> : Califonia had unusually cold weather last week.</p>
      <p><b>Reminder</b> : Try to avoid jargon. Use words that are appropriate for the reader.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>5. Don't use negatives to make a positive without good reason.</strong>
      <p>Terrible : I don't know nothing about computers.</p>
      <p>Better: I don't know anything about computers.</p>
      <p>Better: I know nothing about computers.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Unnecessary: He is not unwilling to help.</p>
      <p>Better: He is willing to help.</p>
      <p>Sometimes a not un-construction may be desirable, perhaps even necessary.</p>
      <p><b>Ex : </b> The book is uneven but not uninteresting.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
